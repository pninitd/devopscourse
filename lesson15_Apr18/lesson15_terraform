terraform â€“v


create new user --> copy access key/private
change the keys in: https://github.com/Dgotlieb/SimpleTerraform

ami - choose ubuntu apt from ec2 instances ui

1. run terraform init    from the project
2. run  terraform plan (just validate)
3. run terraform apply

this will create user group and ec2 with nginx
if not getting the ec2 ip run "terraform destroy" without pressing yes and ip should be printed
or get the ip from aws dashboard.
brows the ip and see nginx, no ssh since port 22 is close and no keys.

from aws ui -> create key pair

at the end run: terraform destroy
